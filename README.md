# Design Patterns
When attending my local C++ club, I asked around what good books to help with Objected Oriented Programming (OOP). People have mentioned the Gang of Four's book "[Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8)" to help with better more flexible and craftsmanship like code. Conveniently, I purchased the book a few years ago and it's been sitting on my shelf. Now is the time to actually learn the material now. So here we go!

# Structure
During the learning process, I will try to link some supplemental resources to help with the content of this book. Having a different points of view or more concise coding examples in a modern syntax clear up the evolution of the C++ language. Additionally, I will personally code some examples of the given design pattern to help me with my own personal understanding.

The goal is to have the code:
* compile
* comment important thoughts and structures
* UML or Sequence diagrams
* unit test the code (Google test)

## Factory Method Pattern
For the factor method, there seems to be three ways it is implemented:
1) Pure Factor Method (creational pattern) 
2) Abstract Factory (creational pattern) implemented using a Factory Method (creational pattern) 
3) Template Method (behavioral pattern) using Factory Method (creational pattern)
